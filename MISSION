(0%) - Get networking done between server and client. That is, the basic connect - send message stuff. Not the entire networking protocol.


(0%) - Get a simple world modeled on the server, which the client neatly displays. This would include moving ants, without purpose

(0%) - Make client able to directly move his owned ant, and make sure this propagates to both clients.

(0%) - Create some basic AI and flesh out the notions of having a colony.
