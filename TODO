wonko:

- new command clears queue (when sending ant to dig, then issue new move-only command, ant still wants to dig!)
- holding shift adds to end of command queue (too RTS?)
- mouse down movement tracking (spray pheromones etc, follow mouse cursor)
- tile based movement/location unnecessary (makes chaotic movement so much more difficult!)
- include z-coordinate for underground (< 0) and climbing over foliage (> 0) for terrain
- Zoom breaks View limitation
