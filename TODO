wonko:

- holding shift adds to end of command queue (too RTS?)
- tile based movement/location unnecessary (makes chaotic movement so much more difficult!)
- include z-coordinate for underground (< 0) and climbing over foliage (> 0) for terrain
- double click location based check, not time based
- debug flag (intention-based color coding, path/trails, debug tileset, full view)
- why are coordinates negative? (camera etc)
- (priority list based on state/pheromones? Attack, gather, dig, run, pull, push, carry, rescue, eat, groom ... )

controls proposal:
Left Click  - Move Ant
Left Hld/Mv - Spray, Lure ant
Double Left - Context dependent action 

Right Click  - Menu
Right Hld/Mv - Move Camera

Shift Hld  - Command Queue
